### React/ Next.js portfolio/ blog template for aesthetically keen design engineers

## Inspiration
Create a useful, no-bloat website template for design engineers to upload 3D CAD models and write blog posts about them.

## And so what is this?
This is something I bootstrapped off various components online to learn Typescript and the React/ Next.js framework. Contains trace amount of articles, 3D models and icons copied off copyright-free websites, mixed random stuff, lousy and messy CSS, and an outdated profile picture.

## Next steps
Polish CSS, create workflow for uploading CAD files and blogs, making this more of a useful reusable template.
